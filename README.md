# Multi-room audio attempt #

For some reason [Airfoil](https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/) doesn't play well with [JBL Playlist 150](https://www.jbl.com/home-speakers-2/JBL+PLAYLIST+150.html).
The speaker just goes to sleep after the 10 minutes of playback. Reporting the bug to Airfoil and JBL supports did little help.
Thus my own streaming solution.
